# gmi_incoming

A basic Python script for constructing bidirectional links across a Gemini site.

Iterates through all internal links and appends incoming links on the
destination pages.

## Usage

We assume that you keep your site's files in a folder and upload it
occasionally. We also assume that you don't link internally with `gemini://`
links; the script accepts either relative or root-oriented paths. 

Clone this repository, add your tilde folder's location if necessary to
`config.py`, `cd` to your site's directory in bash, and run `gmi_incoming.py`
inside that working directory.

The script will output a `site_output` folder. You'd then `cd` into that folder
and `rsync` to your actual site, for example:

```
rsync -zz -avh --del ~/gemdocs/site_output/ you@yoursite:~gemdocs/
```
